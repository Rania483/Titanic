# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning analysis and prediction task based on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to explore the data, perform feature engineering, and train a model to predict passenger survival.

## Project Overview

This notebook includes:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering
* Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
* Model Evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset used is the classic [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), which includes passenger details such as:

* PassengerId
* Pclass
* Name
* Sex
* Age
* SibSp
* Parch
* Ticket
* Fare
* Cabin
* Embarked
* Survived (Target variable)

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * seaborn
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `titanic.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to see the data analysis and model results.

## Results

The notebook concludes with a trained classifier and evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.) to assess performance.
